# Welcome

I appreciate you visiting my site! 

I am currently a post-doctoral clinical fellow at Columbia University Medical Center in Gastroenterology. If you'd like to learn more about me please feel free: [About](about.html)


My work focuses on the microbiome, i.e. the bacteria that live within our intestines. My prior work and training have been geared towards this. Please feel free to review my [CV](education.html)
